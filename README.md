# Leanback Userstyles
A collection of userstyles for the Leanback YouTube interface. Primarily meant to be used with VacuumTube, a YouTube Leanback client for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Disclaimer: None of these userstyles include userCSS/user.css metadata. These have been built with VacuumTube in mind. Feel free to redistribute with metadata + credit. If you modify any of these themes to the extent of overhauling them, please rename it, and please still credit me. 

## How to use with VacuumTube
- Install [VacuumTube here](https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube).
  - Navigate to the Settings "cog" icon on the bottom left corner.
  - Scroll to the "Custom CSS/Userstyles" tab, and select "On".

- **Windows**
  - Open File Explorer, and navigate to `APPDATA%\VacuumTube\userstyles\`
 
- **macOS**
  - Open Finder, and navigate to `~/Library/Application Support/VacuumTube/userstyles/`

- **Linux**
  - ~~Figure it out, use Linux~~
  - Open your Files Manager and navigate either to
    - `~/.config/VacuumTube/userstyles/`
    - or for Flatpak, `~/.var/app/rocks.shy.VacuumTube/config/VacuumTube/userstyles/`

##### In this repo, each folder has a .css file & a preview image. Download the .css file of the respective theme, and put that .css file in the "userstyles" folder.

There doesn't appear to be an option to enable and disable specific themes at this time being, so please use file at a time.
